# Builder Pattern
## Description
A pattern for creating an object with the minimum amount of arguments but can be built on top of if needed.
## Example(s) of when to apply this pattern.
- When we want to supply the minimum amount of data to create a new user but still have the flexibility of adding optional/extra data to the user.
- When we have a card component and we want it to be built out differently for different use cases. For example, a normal card component can have just an image with a description. We can build and extend the card by adding a call to action section for the card to let the user interact with it.
