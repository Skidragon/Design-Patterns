# Facade Pattern
## Description
A pattern used to hide implementation details and have a single place to change its implementation.

## Benefits
- A single place to change implementation details.
- Save time not going through the whole code base and updating every single file that requires the new implementation updates.
## Example(s)
- Replacing fetch api with axios in one single place rather than going to each file and updating the implementation for every single one of them
